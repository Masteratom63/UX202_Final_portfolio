### Project 2 - Speculative Design Project 1 (SDP1)
For this project, our group decided to make a wearable device that can help visually impaired or blind people to get alerted for any obstacles in front of them. </br>
We would have made this device using two ultrasonic sensors to sense the distance of the obstacle in front of them, and two vibration motors which would have different levels for vibration in it. 
We programmed the device to work in such a way that if the obstacle was at 5 meters, then the vibration motors would vibrate on the low setting, but when the obstacle started to get closer, then the vibration motors would vibrate at increasing intensity. 
One motor would be attached on the left hand and the other one on the right hand, and when the obstacle is on the right side, the right-side motor will vibrate, and same for the other side. 
This device would let the person wearing it know the distance and the location of the obstacle on the front of them. 
The first 3 images are of the materials, and the fourth image is of the project image in 3D space, and other images are of the code.
All the images are listed below: </br>
