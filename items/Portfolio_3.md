### Project 3 - Speculative Design Project 2 (SDP2)
For the final project of the term, our group decided to keep working on the previous project, and we tried to make it better in terms of feature, wearability and functionality. </br>
We went ahead and planned a few features that included the Internet of things topic and also added a few non-internet related features.
We added Bluetooth modules to the vibration motors, we added a separate Bluetooth module to the headband, so we can allow the wearer to connect it to their mobile app, and we also added accessible features in the app. </br>
Unfortunately, I don't have updated images of the application, but I can explain a few features of that app. </br>
The app has voice overlay, which reads the things on screen aloud. </br>
It can listen to any audio around them, and can increase the output volume if the user has hearing disability. </br>
It also has an accessible keyboard so that the visually impaired users can easily fill out emergency information on their own.
