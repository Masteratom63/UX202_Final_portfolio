### Project 3 - Speculative Design Project 2 (SDP2)
For the final project of the term, our group decided to keep working on the previous project, and we tried to make it better in terms of feature, wearability and functionality. </br>
We went ahead and planned a few features that included the Internet of things topic and also added a few non-internet related features.
We added Bluetooth modules to the vibration motors, we added a separate Bluetooth module to the headband, so we can allow the wearer to connect it to their mobile app, and we also added accessible features in the app. </br>
