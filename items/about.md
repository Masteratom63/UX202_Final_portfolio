## About Me

I am a student at Wilfrid Laurier University, and I am majoring in User Experience Design (Bachelor of Design). </br>
I am making this website for the portfolio assignment for the class of UX201. </br>
This website is being created and designed fully by using html and css programing language in github, and not with the help of any other website creator, and we started learning about creating website in UX220. And this is just my second time creating a website for a class, the first was for the class of UX220 final project. </br>
And the contact info in the contact part is not real so please don't try and contact it. </br>
I didn't add the real contact info because some times the contact info is copied by some scammers and they try and scam the contact number and contact email.
