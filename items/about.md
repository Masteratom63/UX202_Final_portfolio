## About Me

I am Heer Patel, a student at Wilfrid Laurier University, and I am majoring in User Experience Design (Bachelor of Design). </br>
I am making this website for the portfolio assignment for the class of UX202. </br>
This website is being created and designed fully by using html and css programing language in github, and not with the help of any other website creator, and we started learning about creating website in UX220. And this is just my fourth time creating a website for a class final (in html, because I can't seem to connect to AlterVista and wordpress at the moment, that's why I am resorting to the UX201 format that I created last term). </br>
And the contact info in the contact part is not real so please don't try and contact it. </br>
I didn't add the real contact info because some times the contact info is copied by some scammers and they try and scam the contact number and contact email.
