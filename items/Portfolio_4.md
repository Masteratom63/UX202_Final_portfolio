### Project 4 - 3D Printing Workshop

We also made a 3D printed User Experience Design (UXD) Keytag. </br>
First We had to go into TinkerCAD and make the keytag in the computer, and we had to make sure that every component of the keytag was perfectly aligned in TinkerCAD. </br>
Then we had to download a slicer that would slice the design, and help us get the 3d design in a thumb drive, which we would then insert in the 3d printer and proceed to print it. </br>
